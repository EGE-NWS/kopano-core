Release notes for 8.2.0
=======================
Fixes:
* backup: avoid exceptions on problematic rules/ACLs/delegates [KC-213,KC-266]
* The comment for server.cfg's "disabled_features" was wrong [KC-262]
* php: fix crash by adding missing pointer type conversions [KC-274]
* dagent: the "Received" debugging header had the wrong target address
* gateway: do not emit an X-Mailer field when retrieving mail [KC-277]
* server/ldap: report empty ldap_search_base setting
Enhancements:
* Python 3 support [KC-48,KC-267]
* search: files are now compacted, and their uid/gid checked [KC-188]
* server: allow search folder creation outside of own store [KC-271]
Changes:
* Support for building with a no-SSLv2 OpenSSL 1.1. [KC-230]
  If you run such a setup, be aware that a config setting like
  "ssl_protocol = !SSLv2" in one or more of kopano-{server,gateway,ical}.cfg
  can inhibit the process from starting.
* Cleanup of the example LDAP configuration files. [KC-229]
  /usr/share/doc/kopano/example-configs/ now has just a ldap.cfg,
  and no more ldap{,ms}.{active-directory,ldap}.cfg.
* The example LDAP config file now has a different proposed value for
  ldap_object_search_filter for OpenLDAP. [KC-218]
Developer/packager notes:
* Support for building the source with newer gsoap
  (upto and including 2.8.36) [KC-261]
* KC 8.2 is the first to support 2.8.34+ at runtime. [KC-261]
  Earlier KC releases only support gsoap < 2.8.30 because KC was using
  undocumented behavior for which the generator changed the wire protocol.
Internal:
* Many "goto exit" were abolished and reordered [KC-87]
* for() loop verbosity reduced by using range-based loops [KC-88]
* pthread_mutex calls have been switched to std::mutex [KC-191]
* Coverity report fixes and other possible NULL dereferences [KC-235]
